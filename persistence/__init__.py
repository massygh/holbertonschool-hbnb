Persistence Package

This package contains all the modules related to data persistence in the HBnB Evolution project.
Initially, this package may include file-based persistence mechanisms, but it is designed to be 
extensible to support database persistence in the future.

Modules:
    Currently, there are no specific modules defined for persistence. Future modules could include
    implementations for saving and retrieving data from file-based storage or databases.
